Since arrays are stored in row-order form, then the multiplier of i is the number of second and third order elements combined. The j multiplier is the number of third order elements alone. We also have the total size of A as 3640. 

Given what we have already:

j = 15
k + j = 65 and k = 50
and the size of second and third elements combined is 65* 8 = 520, then i = ((3640 - 520)/8)  = 390

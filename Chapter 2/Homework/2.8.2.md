### 2.8.1

#### A. (x < y) == (-x > -y)

Always true. The sign in the expression on the right hand sign is distributive, meaning it can be taken out of the expression
with equality reversal, then we have - (x < y) which is true if the left hand expression is also true and vica versa.

#### B. ((x+y) << 4) + y - x == 17*y+15*x

It can be false in the case where (x + y) * 16 may lead to overflow, but where 17*y+15*x might not. For example, if (x+y) is 4100 then
it will overflow by 65 if the operands are int type. But if x is 2100 and y is 2000, then no overflow occurs and the values
may be added safely.

#### C. ~x+~y+1 == ~(x+y)

Alwas true:

~x+~y+1 = (~x + 1) + (~y + 1) -1
        = -x + -y -1
        = -(x + y) -1
        = ~(x + y) +1 -1
        = ~(x+y)


#### D. (ux - uy) == - (unsigned) (y-x)

Always true. Firstly, no underflow could ever occur as both x and y are positive, and the most negative value is when ux = 0 and uy = INT_MAX, then
the computation is INT_MIN. Secondly, if uy is less than ux then converting y - x to unsigned has the effect of adding 2 to the power
of w, and the negation of that has the effect of cancelling it while removing the leading sign bit to the same result difference on the left hand side. 

#### E. ((x>>2)<<2) <=x

Always true. If x has 1's in the least 2 significant bits, then its value is increased by 1 to 3. A right-left shift removes
those bits leading to (possibly) increased negativity.

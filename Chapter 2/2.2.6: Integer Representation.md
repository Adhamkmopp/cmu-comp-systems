The code below converts the signed and unsiged short representations (2 bytes) into their int equivalents (4 bytes) and prints their byte representations

```c++

#include <stdio.h>
#include "byte.h"


int main(){

short sx=-12345;
unsigned short usx = sx;
int x = sx;
unsigned ux=usx;

printf("sx = %d:\t", sx);
show_bytes((byte_pointer) &sx, sizeof(short));
printf("usx = %u:\t", usx);
show_bytes((byte_pointer) &usx, sizeof(unsigned short));
printf("x = %d:\t", x);
show_bytes((byte_pointer) &x, sizeof(int));
printf("x = %u:\t", ux);
show_bytes((byte_pointer) &ux, sizeof(unsigned));


};
```

With output

sx = -12345:	 c7 cf
usx = 53191:	 c7 cf
x = -12345:	 c7 cf ff ff
x = 53191:	 c7 cf 00 00

The output shows that signed expansion is done through sign extension (oxFF) and unsiged expansion is done via zero extension. The main takeway is that bit level representations may be inconsistent between integer expansions, specifically for signed integers.

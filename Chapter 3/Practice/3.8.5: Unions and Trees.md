### Interesting Code

The code below is nearly verbatim the example included in the book included here only after looking up the utility of typedef and why it's utility
in defining aliases for structs and enumerations.

```c++

typedef struct rect {
    long llx;
    long lly;
    unsigned long width;
    unsigned long height;
    unsigned color;
};

rect r;
r.lly = r.llx = 0;
r.color = 0x0FFFF;
r.width = 10;
r.height = 20;

long area (rect *rp){
    (*rp).width * rp->height;
}
```

This code is actually interesting in that it defines a neat use for unions as nodes in a binary tree; leaf nodes hold two double data points,
while internal leaves hold pointers to left and right nodes. The only critisism I have over this data structure is the lack of security
in that one has no control over the node type. It is uncorrelated with the active union element and can be easily mislabled 
as a leaf or internal node by chance or on purpose. It could be better to use classes, but how?

```c++

typedef enum {N_LEAF, N_INTERNAL } nodetype_t;

struct node_t {
    nodetype_t type;
    union{
        struct{
            struct node_t *left;
            struct node_t *right;
        }
        double data[2];

    } info;
};
```

### Data Alignment:

"Hardware dependant and you just have to live with it. It's for the best, trust us.". Not a direct quote but pretty much what it is in the book. Arrange elements in structs and objects by the largest to the smallest elements. This will ensure that the k-byte alignment in x86-64 machines is satisfied. It is the smallest odd byte elements (char) that fuck everything up.

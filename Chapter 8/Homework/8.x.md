A. Impossible; parent cannot terminate before children (ends in 1)
B. Impossible; same as above, plus no print("2") is possible without printing 0 or 1 first
C. Impossible; same as A
D. Impossiblel same as the alternate reason given in B
E. Impossible

If I am incorrect in assuming that the ancestor terminates after the children do, then A, C and E would be possible.

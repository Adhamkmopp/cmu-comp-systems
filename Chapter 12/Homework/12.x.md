A.  Unsafe: the updated value from 2 was not saved before it was loaded by 1.
B.  Safe.
C.  Unsafe: the same value was loaded and updated seperately. The value from 1 overwrites 2.

Adding a second mutex that can only be icremented inside the main reader function applies a second lock that guarantees that readers are given a strong priority. 

~~~c

int readcnt;
sem_t mutex, w, wplus;

void reader(void)
{
    while(1) {
    P(&mutex);
    P(&wplus);
    readcnt++;
    if (readcnt == 1)
        P(&w);
    V(&mutex);

    /* Critical Section */

    P(&mutex);
    readcnt--;

    if(readcnt == 0)
        V(&w);
    V(&wplus);
    V(&mutex);
    
    }
}

void writer(void){
    while(1){
        P(&w);
        P(&wplus);
        /* Critical Section */
        V(&w);
    }
}

The solution I think is to remove the condition imposed on the P and V operations inside the main reader function. Now reader and writer threads have the exact same locking mechanism.

~~~c
#include "csapp.h"

int readcnt;
sem_t mutex, w, wplus;

void reader(void)
{
    while(1) {
    P(&mutex);
    readcnt++;
    
    P(&w);
    /* Critical Section */

    P(&mutex);
    readcnt--;

    V(&w);
    V(&mutex);
    
    }
}

void writer(void){
    while(1){
        P(&w);
        /* Critical Section */
        V(&w);
    }
}
